# RPG Game - Navigation Practice

## Description

You work for a mobile gaming company who is building the next RPG gaming hit! They're still in the early phases of development though, so don't expect anything fancy.

Right now they're working on the ability for users to select their player type, and have that selection be passed through the navigation controller so the appropriate action can take place. **Your job as the new developer is to implement this functionality!**
